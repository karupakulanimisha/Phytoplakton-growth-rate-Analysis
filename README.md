# Phytoplakton-growth-rate-Analysis
Over the course of several months and years, there was a consistent decrease in phytoplankton growth. 												
This decline is concerning, given the critical role phytoplankton play in the Earth's ecosystems and human survival. 																		
Phytoplankton are the foundation of aquatic food chains, produce about half of the world's oxygen, and play a significant role in carbon sequestration.																		
																		
The data collected and analyzed includes factors such as chlorophyll concentration, oxygen levels, temperature, salinity,																		
 and essential nutrients like dissolved silicon, nitrogen, and phosphorus. These parameters were measured 																		
to understand the complex interactions  influencing phytoplankton growth and to determine the rate of its decline.
